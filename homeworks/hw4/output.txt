Question 4
Once the two galaxies are close to merging, there will be gigantic outliers in terms of velocity and distance from the centre. These will not be isotropically distributed, since as the merger occurs, there is a tail behind one of the galaxies. This iterative processes will remove most outliers, and give us the true COM of the galaxies.
