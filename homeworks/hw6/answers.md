1. As we can see in the graph of MW vs M31 separation, we notice that there are three close encounters: one at ~4Gyr, another at ~6Gyr, and a final encounter that merges the two galaxies.

2. As the separation decreaes, the velocity increases, and vice versa. 

3. M33 joins the MW, and thus its orbit merges almost entirely, with only very small deviations from the orbit of the MW.

4. About 10.
