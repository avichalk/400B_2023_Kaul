 1. Total Mass of MW vs M31: Ratio of 1.0. Halo Mass dominates.

 2. Stellar Mass of MW vs M31: Ratio of 0.612. As M31 contains more stellar mass, which is the only type of mass that directly contributes to the luminosity of a galaxy, we expect it to be more luminous.

 3. Dark Matter Content of MW vs M31: Ratio of 1.0. Yes - despite the stark difference in stellar matter, they have almost exactly the same dark matter content!

 4. Baryonic Fraction $f_{bar}$ for each galaxy is MW:0.041, M31:0.067, M33:0.046. Our baryonic fractions are universally lower than the provided value of 16\%. Here are the True Fraction / Provided Fraction values for the various galaxies: MW:0.25625, M31:0.41875, M33:0.2875. This discrepancy might come down to the large amounts of interstellar gas and dust between galaxies; as galaxies are mostly dark matter, their bayonic fraction is significantly lower than the rest of the universe.
