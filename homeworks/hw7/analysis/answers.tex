\begin{enumerate}
	\item The plots are very different. While one seems to show many close encounters, the other only shows one close encounter, and then the two galaxies move away on a long arc before coming back together.
	\item The dynamical friction from the Dark Matter Halo seems unaccounted for. Could it be the reason we don't see a more dramatic interaction at the start?
	\item We could include the MW by creating a similar class for MW's effect on M31, and simply incorporating it into the calculation. Though, this seems like a naive approach, as it does not consider M33's effect on the MW.
