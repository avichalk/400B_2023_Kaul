\title{The Fate of Andromeda and the Milky Way}

\begin{document}
  \maketitle
  In around 6-8 Gyr, the Milky Way will merge with its closest galactic counterpart, Andromeda i.e. M31. I wish to study the baryonic evolution through close encounters during this collision; namely, the evolution of stellar debris in tidal tails and bridges. I would also like to study the effect, if any, the two supermassive black holes in the centre of their respective galaxies have on the formation and evolution of these structures.
