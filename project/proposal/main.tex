\title{The Fate of Andromeda and the Milky Way}
\author{Avichal Kaul}

\begin{document}
  \maketitle
  In around 6-8 Gyr, the Milky Way will merge with its closest galactic counterpart, Andromeda i.e. M31. I wish to study the baryonic evolution through close encounters during this collision; namely, the evolution of stellar debris in tidal tails and bridges, and the evolution of the bars of the galaxies.
